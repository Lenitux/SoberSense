Breathalyzer Project

This repository contains the C code developed for a breathalyzer project. The code is designed to run on an STM32 microcontroller and interfaces with an MQ-3 alcohol sensor. The breathalyzer system measures alcohol concentration in the breath and converts sensor readings to Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) values.
Key Features

    STM32 Compatibility: The code is tailored to run on STM32 microcontrollers, offering compatibility and optimization for embedded systems.

    MQ-3 Sensor Interface: Interfaces with the MQ-3 alcohol sensor to obtain analog readings representing the alcohol concentration in the air.

    Exponential Equation Conversion: Implements an exponential equation derived from calibration data to convert sensor readings to BAC values.

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/breathalyzer-project.git
    cd breathalyzer-project

    Configure STM32 Development Environment:
    Set up your STM32 development environment to compile and flash the code onto your microcontroller.

    Adjust Calibration Values:
    Modify the calibration values in the code based on your sensor's calibration data for accurate BAC calculations.

    Compile and Flash:
    Compile the code and flash it onto your STM32 microcontroller using your preferred development environment.

Usage

    Connect the STM32 board to the MQ-3 alcohol sensor.
    Power up the system and wait for the warm-up period.
    Blow into the sensor, and the system will provide BAC readings based on the calibrated exponential equation.
